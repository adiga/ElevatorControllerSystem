Elevator Controller System
*******************************************************************************

The objective of this project is to build a small embedded system using a 
microcontroller and its peripherals.

This project demostrates the use of HC6812 microcontroller to create a 3 level
elevator controller system. Along with the microcontoller a peripheral 
circuit consisting of a DC motor (output to control the movement of elevator), 
a keypad (user input for level selection) and a few IR sensors (level sensors
for controlling the elevator) are used.
